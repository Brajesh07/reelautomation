# Astrology Reel Automation – React + Canvas Specification

## Purpose
Create a **data-driven animated reel system** to replace manual After Effects work for daily astrology reels.

- Platform: Instagram Reels / Shorts
- Orientation: Vertical (9:16)
- Total Duration: **01:10 (70 seconds)**
- Zodiacs per reel: **3**
- Animation & design remain fixed
- **Only dynamic content changes** per reel

---

## Core Rule (Very Important)

- **Square brackets `[ ]`** → Static content (never changes)
- **Curly brackets `{ }`** → Dynamic content (comes from JSON)

This rule must be followed everywhere in the project.

---

## What Is Dynamic

ONLY the following text changes:
- Zodiac name
- Vibe sentence
- Yellow-box content under:
  - Love
  - Career
  - Money
  - Soul Message

All icons, gold text, background, layout, and transitions remain unchanged.

---

## JSON Data Model (FINAL)

⚠️ Text must remain **inside ONE yellow box**
⚠️ Line breaks are handled using `\n` inside strings

```json
{
  "date": "16 January 2026",
  "zodiacs": [
    {
      "name": "Scorpio",
      "vibe": "Trusting your instincts brings confidence and clarity.",
      "love": "Patience and guidance help\nyou move past emotional delays.",
      "career": "Learning opportunities and\nnetworking support growth.",
      "money": "Smart budgeting brings stability\nand peace of mind.",
      "soulMessage": "When you trust yourself,\nthe path becomes clear."
    },
    {
      "name": "Libra",
      "vibe": "A timely connection brings clarity and steady focus.",
      "love": "Patience helps you move past\nemotional misunderstandings.",
      "career": "Networking opens doors to\nvaluable future opportunities.",
      "money": "Thoughtful decisions protect and\nstrengthen your finances.",
      "soulMessage": "Trust the timing — support arrives\nwhen needed most."
    },
    {
      "name": "Sagittarius",
      "vibe": "Honest conversations bring emotional relief and harmony.",
      "love": "Giving space allows feelings\nto settle and clarity to return.",
      "career": "Learning and networking\nsupport long-term growth.",
      "money": "Careful planning leads to\nrecognition and steady gains.",
      "soulMessage": "Patience today creates\nstronger tomorrows."
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Rendering Rules (Canvas)

- All text is rendered in **HTML Canvas**
- No DOM text overlays
- Yellow boxes must auto-resize based on text height
- Line breaks are rendered using `\n`

Pseudo logic:
```js
const lines = text.split("\n");
lines.forEach((line, i) => {
  ctx.fillText(line, x, y + i * lineHeight);
});
```

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- ReactJS
- HTML Canvas
- GSAP (timeline animations)

### Automation / Export
- Node.js
- Puppeteer (frame capture)
- FFmpeg (PNG → MP4)

---

## Key Notes for Developer

- Think of each zodiac as one **scene**
- GSAP timeline = After Effects timeline
- Animation auto-plays on page load
- No user interaction needed
- System should support future batch generation

---

## Success Criteria

- Daily reel can be generated by editing JSON only
- No After Effects usage
- Output matches provided reference frames exactly
- MP4 export ready for Instagram
